## Programming for Geospatial II  
**MSc Geoinformatics – Semester 2**

This repository contains **Practical Exercise 1 and Exercise 2**, completed in a **single Google Colab notebook** using **Google Earth Engine and geemap**.

---

### Notebook
- `Prac_EX1-2.ipynb` – Combined notebook for EX-1 and EX-2

---

### Exercise 1
- Selected a taluk boundary
- Downloaded and clipped OSM vector layers (landuse, water bodies, waterways, roadways, railways, buildings)
- Uploaded all layers to Google Earth Engine Assets
- Visualized all layers together in Google Colab with appropriate symbology and basemap

---

### Exercise 2
- Selected one optical dataset and one DEM from the GEE Data Catalog
- Clipped datasets using the same taluk boundary
- Computed and visualized NDVI
- Visualized DEM
- Exported NDVI and DEM as GeoTIFF
- Converted taluk boundary and OSM layers to GeoJSON and uploaded to GitHub

> **Note:** Interactive maps render in Google Colab. GitHub displays the code and static outputs only.
